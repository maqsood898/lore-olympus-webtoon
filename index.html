                                Persephone is depicted with pink skin and a generous heart, a stark contrast to the

            <p>Persephone, the goddess of spring, is the story’s heroine alongside the underworld. Initially portrayed
                as an innocent and naive young woman, her character develops dramatically as she faces more challenges.
                Persephone is depicted with pink skin and a generous heart, a stark contrast to the harsh reality of
                Olympus. Her journey included discovering her strength, and she dealt with the trauma of being raped by
                Apollo, as well as her strong feelings about the underworld.</p>

            <p>Zeus, the king of the gods, is depicted as a yellow-skinned man with long, straight hair. Known for his
                promiscuity and egotism, Zeus’ actions often brought chaos to Olympus. A member of the Six Realms of
                Lies, he has intimate relationships with many characters, including his brothers Hades and Poseidon, and
                many lovers. His character provides a lens through which to examine issues of power and corruption.</p>

            <p>Poseidon, the God of the sea, is Zeus’s brother from the underworld. He is usually characterized by a
                carefree and quick temperament, portrayed with green skin and long, wavy hair. Despite being slightly
                less witted, Poseidon is very loyal to his family. His relationship with his wife Amphitrite and their
                polygamous arrangement add an intriguing dynamic to his character.</p>

                Persephone’s best friends and knows the depression she is enduring. Eros is supportive and loving, often
